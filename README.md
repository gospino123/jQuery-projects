## jQuery
Although JavaScript can do everything that jQuery can do, jQuery *can* make JavaScript faster to write and easier to read. These projects are meant to assist in understanding jQuery use and it's presentation in web pages that still use it. Future projects will focus on more modern libraries like *React* and *Vue*.
