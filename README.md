## jQuery
Although JavaScript can do everything that jQuery can do, jQuery *can* make JavaScript faster to write and easier to read. These projects are meant to assist in understanding jQuery use and it's presentation in web pages that still use it. Future projects will focus on more modern libraries like *React* and *Vue*.

### Projects
These are projects completed in the Codecademy jQuery course:

1. [Madison Square Market](https://gospino123.github.io/jQuery-projects/madison-square-market/)

   In this project, I start with code and add some basic functionality to a dropdown menu using jQuery.

2. [Trivia Card](https://gospino123.github.io/jQuery-projects/trivia-card/)

   With starter code, I implemented jQuery effects to give the user the ability to read the clue, view an optional hint, and select their answer. I also altered the CSS a bit and added a reset button.
